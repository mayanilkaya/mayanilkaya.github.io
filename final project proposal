# Final Project Proposal

##Title: My Portfolio Website


##My project is about creating a professional website where I can share my
compositions, performances, and art works.

It's going to have a main page with my name, my contact info etc. There's going
to be a menu with 'about', 'listen', and 'watch'.
When you click on about, it's going to take you to my biography, listen is going
to take you to my recordings, and watch is going to take you to my visual work.

I want to accomplish creating a website that I could use professionally, and
that I could develop later on.

I can create the website, have my name and contact info,  and a list of things
to choose from on the main page.

I will need to research how to create websites using html (even though we went over
it in class), and most importantly how to make it look the way I want to.

Three resources I will use:

https://github.com/akashyap2013/PortFolio_Website/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file
https://github.com/nsoch/nsoch.github.io/blob/master/pages/about.html
